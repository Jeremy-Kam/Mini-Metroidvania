My first original game. I have done many projects that emulated other games to learn Unity and Godot and followed many tutorials. It was a passion project, and I did every aspect of the development by myself, including the art, sound, and code. I enlisted the help of close friends to playtest it a few times during development. It gave me a new appreciation of how much work games require, even simple ones.
